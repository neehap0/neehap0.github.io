I will love you as long as I live through

But I knew it wouldn't last

Some new sunshine and we had to see the bigger picture choose another path 

So ill let the light of my stars guide your way

And I'll hold on to your smile as you go away

And every road you take will always lead you home

Because i promise i'd set my heart on fire
if i had to light your way you chose 

And im glad to see you in a better place without me
 
Maybe together was something we were never meant to be
